# obstical_avoidane_system_esp32
This project detects obstacles using an IR sensor and responds by displaying messages on an LCD and Blynk dashboard. It also uses colored LEDs and a buzzer to indicate whether the path is clear or blocked.
# ðŸš— Obstacle Avoidance System (ESP32)

## Overview
This project implements an intelligent obstacle avoidance system using the ESP32 microcontroller. It combines sensor-based detection, real-time decision logic, and clear documentation to support replication and understanding.

## Tech Stack
- ESP32 microcontroller (Obstical_avoidance_system.ino)
- Ultrasonic or IR sensors for obstacle detection
- Excel for pin configuration
- Word documentation for system overview

## Files Included
- `Obstical_avoidance_system.ino`: ESP32 sketch for obstacle detection and avoidance logic
- `Obstical_Avoidance_System.docx`: Detailed documentation of system design and operation
- `Obstical_Avoidance_system.xlsx`: Pin configuration and hardware mapping
- `Obstical_avoidance_system.jpg`: Photo of the physical setup
- `circuit_image (2).png`: Circuit diagram
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions

## Highlights
- Real-time obstacle detection and response using embedded logic
- Modular code structure for easy adaptation to other platforms
- Clear documentation and pin mapping for reproducibility
- Visual assets for hardware setup and circuit layout

## How It Works
- Sensors detect obstacles in the path of the system
- ESP32 processes the input and triggers movement decisions (e.g., stop, turn)
- Circuit and pin mapping ensure accurate signal flow and control
